## Woof and Bean

Woof and Bean is a coffee and dog lovers' e-commerce website. Users can purchase various coffee-related paraphernalia and the perfect toy or treat for their special canine friend all in one place. By browsing via specific categories and using sorting filters such as name, date added, and category, as well as searching for keywords, the user can quickly find exactly what they are looking for. The basic functionality of the site comprises the user being able to register for a private account, log in and out, create orders by paying via Stripe, and receive confirmation emails when the order is created. Additional functionality has been added to the user experience, and these details will be discussed further in this document.

## User Experience (UX)
### Project Goals

The goal of Woof and Bean is to provide a functional e-commerce experience to simulate the ability for users to browse products, add them to the cart, check out, receive order confirmation emails, and have a record of past orders within their account.

* When developing Woof and Bean, the main goal was to improve upon the basic functionality as outlined above in this document and enhance the user experience further. The additional functionality is as follows:
    * Users can easily create and edit a private wishlist while still being able to add the products directly to their shopping cart from the wishlist itself.
    * A contact form for the user to be able to contact the site admins with queries, issues, or suggestions, and then receive an email confirmation that their message was successfully sent.
* Accessibility was at the forefront of design and development. Using a contrasting colour palette ensures the site is easily accessible to users regardless of abilities, making the experience more enjoyable for all.

## Design
### Colour Scheme

![Image of colour scheme](docs/images/woofandbeancolorpalette.jpg)

The colour scheme of Woof and Bean is primarily comprised of Onyx, White, and Peach.

* The background is Onyx to ensure the site is not bright and harsh on the eyes of the user when browsing products.
* The site text is predominately White and Peach, to ensure readability but also to provide enough contrast with the Onyx background matching the brand logo colours.
* The Choice of colours along with eye strain and readability in mind matches that of the company logo invoking a premium or luxury feeling.

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) Was used to import the font featured on the site. The Font used is of the type sans-serif for consistency.

![Image of Stripe Element Font](docs/images/poppins-font.jpg)
* I adjusted the Stripe element font to use "Poppins" to bring it in line and consistent with the rest of the website typography.

![Image of Body Font and Title Font](docs/images/poppins-font.jpg)
* I chose the "Poppins" font for both the header and body of the site to keep a consistent and legible font throughout. Utilising Uppercase and bold font weights to highlight headers and important information for the user to pay attention to.

### Icons and Images

* All icons used throughout the site were provided by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as their style is aesthetically pleasing while being consistent and easily understandable.
* I sourced an icon from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com) that will be attributed in the credits section of this document. I then used [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) to convert this .png to an icon file and imported that to my site. I installed a Favicon to help users distinguish this tab from others in their browser, the simple coffee bean design achieves this.
* All product images will be attributed in the credits section, along with the hero image on the home page.
* The home page image serves to provide an aesthetically pleasing and luxurious feel to the page while making clear that this site is a premium seller of boutique coffee and dog paraphernalia.

### Models
I created 2 unique models for this project, Contact, and Wishlist, and designed a model schema diagram to illustrate the relationship between models. I used [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/diagrams) to create these diagrams and was limited by the data types available on their site so some of the data types listed are incorrect. The accurate data and model field types can be found in each respective models.py file but I still wanted to use this software to illustrate the relationship between models. The DrawSQL site doesn't allow Foreign Keys to be attached to the entire model and so I have had to link fields to other specific fields where again this is inaccurate to the actual models. Below is the model diagram purely for representational purposes.
![Model image](/docs/images/models.jpg)

### Features
Woof and Bean is comprised of 11 core sections: Home page, Signup, Login, Profile, Wishlist, Products view, Product Details, Shopping Bag view, Checkout, Checkout Success and Contact Us.

* All pages feature the main nav bar, on desktop this includes the title, and search bar which can search for terms in Product titles, Categories, and Descriptions. The My Account drop-down features Product Management which is only accessible to the superuser (or site management) and can be used to add, edit, or delete products. The My Wishlist page and My Profile pages can also be accessed through this dropdown, along with being able to log out if a user is logged in. The Contact form is accessible through the Contact Us Navigation link on the main Navbar, and the bag icon displays up-to-date bag information which can be clicked to bring the user to the Shopping Bag page. The main navbar also features a Home page link for users on mobile and the All Products link drop-down shows all products, products by category, and products by price that can be filtered in the menu. Canine allows users to select and view only products relating to dogs with a drop-down menu to allow the user to choose either all Canine, treats, and toys specifically, similarly, the Coffee link on the nav bar allows the user to choose all coffee-related products, Accessories and beans/pre-ground.
* Each page also includes a footer displaying copyright information and social media links for the site.
* All pages on the site are responsive across multiple different screen sizes, on smaller screens like mobile phones the top navbar is condensed into a hamburger menu to ensure the screen isn't cluttered while maintaining the same functionality as that found on larger screens.
* For all actions a user performs on the site a pop-up message will appear either confirming that their requested action has been successful or giving them details of the action they've just performed. For example, adding, removing, or altering a product in the shopping bag will all be accompanied by messages unique to the action performed.

| Section | Feature | Photograph or gif |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Home page features an image of a woman and her dog in a luxurious coffee shop, along with a call to action alerting the user new collections have arrived in store with a large bright "shop now" button to encourage the user to view all the products | Upon loading the site users are greeted with the home page image which aims to convey the luxurious nature of the site draw their attention to the large shop now button as the colours pop against the background image of a woman in a coffee shope with her dog and this immediately conveys the purpose of the site as one that products for dog and coffee lovers | ![Home Image](/docs/images/home-image.jpg) |
| The Sign Up page allows users to register for an account with the site | The sign up form encourages users who already have an account to sign in instead by showing both a text link and button to redirect users to the Log In page | ![Sign Up Form](/docs/images/sign-up.jpg)
| | The Sign Up form asks users to input their email address which must be unique to their account, and choose a username which again must be unique to their account and has a maximum length set by Django as 150 characters. The username field permits users to use special characters, numbers and letters to allow for usernames to be unique if there's a large client base. The form then asks the user to set a password, confirm their password and click the Sign Up button. All fields on the Sign Up form are required and the user cannot click Sign Up without successfully filling in these fields. | |
| The Log In page allows users to log who have registered for an account to log in to their already existing account | It encourages users who do not yet have an account to register before attempting to log in by providing a text link to the Sign Up page | ![Sign In page](/docs/images/sign-in.jpg) | 
| | The Log In form asks users to input their username, or email and their password, if a username or password combination is entered that doesn't exist an error displays stating "The username and/or password you specified are not correct" | ![Log In error](/docs/images/username-password-error.jpg) |
| | There is a radio button with the text 'Remember me' that allows users to select whether they want their log in information to be saved for the next time they visit the site | ![Remember me box](/docs/images/remember-me.jpg) | 
| | Django comes with ready-made password reset functionality so users are able to click a link stating they forgot their password. This redirects them to a page where they can enter their email address and an email with a link to reset their password is sent to their specified email address | ![Password Reset](/docs/images/password-reset.jpg) |
| The Profile page includes sections for a user's default delivery information, and their order history | The Profile page allows users to input their default delivery information so this information can be saved to their account and autofill on the checkout page, this isn't only a quality of life change but might encourage more users to go through with a purchase if the system is quick and easy | ![Default Delivery Information](/docs/images/default-delivery.jpg) | 
| | The Profile page displays a user's order history with information including their order number, date and time of purchase, the items and quantities ordered, and their order total. When the order number is clicked it brings users to their order confirmation which is initially displayed after a purchase made been made | ![Order History](/docs/images/order-history.jpg) |
| The Wishlist page allows users to view, remove, and add to basket products in their wishlist, though only if they are logged in | If a user has no items on their wishlist they are met with a message. 'Your wishlist is empty to add products visit a product page and click "add to wishlist"' | ![No products in wishlist view](/docs/images/wishlist-empty.jpg)|
| | When a user has added an item to their wishlist they can view this product in their Wishlist page, here the product image, name, price, date added, and two actions an add to bag button that add's the product to the users bag and a remove button that removes the product from the users wishlist. | ![Wishlist with products](/docs/images/wishlist.jpg) |
| The Products view shows all products available for sale, it allows users to browse all available products, filter them by category, and to sort by price, alphabetised name, and alphabetised category. | Clicking any of the category buttons takes the user to a page that only displays products that match their request. The 'sort by...' box allows users to sort from low to high on price | ![All Products view](/docs/images/all-products.jpg) |
| | The product pages (whether All products or a filtered category page) displays the products in cards with the product image, title, price, and the category tag. For site managers like the superuser, there are also edit and delete buttons for product stock control. Due to the amount of products displayed on each page there is a back-to-top button to allow users to quickly and easily return to the top of the page | ![All Products Cards](/docs/images/all-products-card.jpg) |
| The Products Detail page is accessed when a user clicks on the title or image of a product on the All Products (or any product category) page. Each product detail page shows information about that product exclusively, along with letting users add it to their wishlist, choose a quantity, and add it to their bag. | This page displays the Products image, title, price, category tags, and description. If a user adds a product to their bag a message pops up confirming that this item has been added, and the bag icon in the navbar updates based on the price. | ![Product details page](/docs/images/product-details.jpg) |
| | The 'add to wishlist' button is featured above the product details below the category tag and when clicked adds the product to the user's Wishlist page. If a product is in a user's wishlist this button changes its text to say 'Already in wishlist' to let users know the product is already in their wishlist | ![remove from wishlist](/docs/images/already-in-wishlist.jpg) |
| The Shopping Bag view is accessed by clicking the bag icon in the navbar, this page shows the current contents of the bag along with product information | If nothing is in the bag text stating 'Your bag is empty' will display along with a button encouraging users to keep shopping. When an item (or multiple) is added a success message is displayed in the top right corner of the screen to let users know that their product has been added to the bag. This message explains which product, the quantity added along with the price, and a message that has calculated how much more the user would need to spend to get free delivery. | ![Add to bag success message](/docs/images/add-to-bag-success.jpg) |
| | After clicking the bag icon the user sees the contents of their bag, including the product image, name, sku, price, quantity and subtotal. The quantity of the product selected can be altered here using the quantity input, if this is altered the subtotal adjusts accordingly, items can also be removed from the bag using the remove button. The bag total is displayed lower down the page along with the delivery cost and grand total, with another message stating how much more the user would need to spend to receive free delivery. From here the user can either click 'keep shopping' to return to the products page, or click 'secure checkout' to proceed to the checkout page | ![Shopping bag page](/docs/images/shopping-bag.jpg) |
| The checkout page shows an order summary and then asks the user to fill out the details, delivery, and payment form to complete their order | The order summary consists of the product image, name, and quantity with its subtotal. The Delivery cost and grand total are displayed again | ![Checkout Summary](/docs/images/checkout-summary.jpg) |
| | The checkout form is comprised of fields for Full Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Street Address, Town or City, Post Code, and a dropdown country selector. There is also a radio button where users can opt to save this delivery information to their profile if they're logged in. If a user has previously opted to save information to their profile this form will be auto-populated. The payment field is at the bottom of the form where users can enter their card details, along with a button that either redirect the user back to their bag or complete their order with Stripe validating their details. There is also a message displayed in red underneath this 'Complete Order' button to warn users that their card is about to be charged, and how much. All required fields of the form must be entered for the 'Complete Order' button to be clicked and the order to be successfully processed. When the 'Complete Order' button is clicked a peach overlay appears on screen with a spinning arrow circle to demonstrate that the order is being processed. | ![Checkout Form](/docs/images/checkout.jpg) |
| The checkout success, or thank you page is reached after an order has been processed and displays the order information | The page confirms that the order has gone through successfully and tells the user which email their confirmation will be sent to. An example of this confirmation email is shown in the images section of this table, and upon deployment this will send the confirmation email to the user's real email address | ![Order confirmation email](/docs/images/order-confirmation-email.jpg) |
| | The order success page confirms the following details: order number, order date, the item(s) ordered along with the quantity, the full delivery details provided, and the full billing information. Below this is a button encouraging users to 'Continue Shopping' which would redirect them to the all products page| ![Order confirmation](/docs/images/order-confirmation.jpg) |
| The Contact form can be accessed whether a user is logged in or not, and simply asks users to fill in the following information: their name, email, subject line, and message, a button is shown below to allow users to submit their message | All fields in this form are required and the form cannot be submitted without all being filled in correctly | ![Contact Form](/docs/images/contact-form.jpg) |
| | The contact form is set up to send a confirmation email to the user with their message subject, and content repeated back to them so they have a copy of the communication. The email also states that Woof and Bean will respond within 48 hours, but if the message is urgent a contact number is listed | ![Contact form confirmation](/docs/images/contact-confirmation.jpg) |

* Future Implementations:
  * Ideally, I would like to implement a stock count feature for site managers and admin to be notified by email when the stock of an item is getting low.
  * I'd like to implement a stock available feature to show the user the remaining stock on an item.
  * In the future, I'd like to implement functionality that would allow the user to go to a product details page by clicking on the name or image of the product in their bag, due to time constraints I couldn't get this working in time for submission.
  * I also would like to add a rating functionality to the products and give the users the ability to rate products they have previously purchased so the product rating can be shown to new and existing customers.

### Accessibility

* Throughout the development of this site accessibility was a priority, semantic HTML, alt tags, and aria-labels are used wherever possible to assist screen readers. The font chosen is I believe, legible regardless of the screen size the user is on.

* Lighthouse gave my site a score in the 90's this demonstrates that I have prioritised accessibility throughout development and have implemented accessible features where needed whilst not compromising on the company brand and colour scheme.
    
    ![Lighthouse Accessibility Score](/docs/images/accessibility.jpg)

### Wireframes
During development, I utilised the boutique ado walkthrough layout as a template and adjusted the styling to fit my needs. The two custom models (Contact and Wishlist) I wireframed out in a style to fit the rest of the site seamlessly.

* [Stripe](/docs/images/stripe-js-hint.jpg)
* [Quantity Input Calculator](/docs/images/quantity-input-script-js-hint.jpg)

### Python Linter

The following files were tested with a [Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to ensure PEP8 compliance, and all files apart from settings.py passed with no errors.

* [Bag contexts.py](/docs/images/bag-contexts.jpg)
* [Bag urls.py](/docs/images/bag-urls.jpg)
* [Bag views.py](/docs/images/bag-views.jpg)
* [Checkout admin.py](/docs/images/checkout-admin.jpg)
* [Checkout forms.py](/docs/images/checkout-forms.jpg)
* [Checkout models.py](/docs/images/checkout-models.jpg)
* [Checkout signals.py](/docs/images/checkout-signals.jpg)
* [Checkout urls.py](/docs/images/checkout-urls.jpg)
* [Checkout views.py](/docs/images/checkout-views.jpg)

* [Products widgets.py](/docs/images/products-widgets.jpg)
* [Profile forms.py](/docs/images/profiles-forms.jpg)
* [Profile models.py](/docs/images/profiles-models.jpg)
* [Profile urls.py](/docs/images/profiles-urls.jpg)
* [Profile views.py](/docs/images/profiles-views.jpg)
* [Woof and Bean settings.py](/docs/images/settings.jpg) - settings.py in the Woof and Bean app was the only file to show line length warnings, these affected the AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS and were not created, or updated by myself so I have left them as Django intended.
* [Woof and Bean urls.py](/docs/images/woofandbean-urls.jpg)

### Flake8
After using the CI Python linter to individually check the compliance of each Python page I used the command 'python3 -m flake8' in the terminal to further check for anything I may have missed. The results of this are below:
![Flake8 1](/docs/images/flake8-1.jpg)
![Flake8 2](/docs/images/flake8-2.jpg)

The only unresolved errors I got back were as follows:
* Errors related to .vscode files these lines were not ones that I created or edited in any way.
* The same as above goes for errors concerning the migrations files which comprised the majority of these linting warnings.
* The checkout webhooks file is flagged for the variable 'e' being assigned but not used however this variable has been assigned to catch exceptions or errors in the code that may occur with webhooks and Stripe.
* The contact views.py file warns that three variables 'name', 'subject', and 'content' are assigned but never used, these variables need to be assigned so that they can be accessed in the confirmation email sent to users.
* Setting.py file is showing line length issues again these lines are generated by Django as explained above as well as flagging unused imports that as far as I'm aware are being used.
* No other errors or warnings were documented and I feel confident that the project is up to industry standard for Python conventions.
